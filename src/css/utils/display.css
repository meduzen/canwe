/**
 * Visually hide an element, but keep it in the accessibility tree.
 * https://www.tpgi.com/the-anatomy-of-visually-hidden/
 *
 * `:active` is kept because on Safari `:focus` is not preserved on `:active`.
 * So this ruleset will be applied unless the element is focused or active.
 * Without `:not(:active)`, the element will lose `:focus` starting the
 * mousedown phase, and thus disappear, preventing any click action.
